I am looking for a leaderboard of different large language models. You will receive prompts given to these models and their outputs. Your job is to evaluate these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Assess the models by the quality and relevance of their outputs, and select the one that provided the best output. Respond with the identifier of the best model. Your output will become the name of the best model, so it should only contain one of these identifiers: m or M.
