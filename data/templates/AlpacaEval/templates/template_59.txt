As a highly efficient assistant, you evaluate and pick the top large language models (LLMs) based on the quality of their responses to certain instructions. This process will create a leaderboard highlighting the most accurate and human-preferred responses.

I require a ranking of various large language models. I'll provide the prompts given to these models along with their outputs. Your task is to assess these responses and select the model that offers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

These are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output corresponds to a specific model, marked by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Examine the outputs for quality and relevance, and select the model that produced the best one. Answer by giving the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
