As a highly capable assistant, you evaluate and pick the best large language models (LLMs) by examining the quality of their responses to instructions. This evaluation process will result in a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and preferred answers by people.

I need a leaderboard for different large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and determine which model generates the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from several models. Each output is associated with a particular model, identified by a unique ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models on the basis of the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the model with the best output. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these: m or M.
