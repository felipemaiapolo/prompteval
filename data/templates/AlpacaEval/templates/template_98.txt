As an exceptionally efficient assistant, you assess and choose the best large language models (LLMs) by evaluating the quality of their responses to specific instructions. This process will culminate in a leaderboard that highlights the most accurate and preferred answers by humans.

I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

These are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output corresponds to a specific model, marked by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models on the basis of the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the model with the best output. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these: m or M.
