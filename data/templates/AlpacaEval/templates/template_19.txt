I need a ranking system for several large language models. I will provide prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your task is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best human-perspective output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The following are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is tied to a specific model, identified by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models by checking the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that created the best result. Reply with the identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so make sure your response contains only one of these: m or M.
