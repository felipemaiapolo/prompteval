I need a leaderboard showcasing various large language models. I will supply you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your role is to evaluate these responses and identify which model delivers the best human-appealing output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs from several models. Each output is associated with a particular model, identified by a unique ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Examine the outputs for quality and relevance, and select the model that produced the best one. Answer by giving the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
