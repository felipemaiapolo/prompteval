I need a ranking system for several large language models. I will provide prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your task is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best human-perspective output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The following are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is tied to a specific model, identified by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models on the basis of the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the model with the best output. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these: m or M.
