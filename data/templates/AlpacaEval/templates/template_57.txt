I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models based on the relevance and quality of their outputs, and select the model that generated the top output. Reply with the model identifier of the best one. Your output will serve as the name of the best model, so make sure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
