I need a leaderboard showcasing various large language models. I will supply you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your role is to evaluate these responses and identify which model delivers the best human-appealing output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Displayed here are the unordered outputs from different models. Each output is tied to a particular model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on their output quality and relevance, and select the one that generated the best result. Provide the identifier of the best model in your response. Your answer will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
