In your role as a highly efficient assistant, you assess and select the best large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the quality of their responses to given instructions. This will lead to a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and favored answers by people.

I need a ranking system for several large language models. I will provide prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your task is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best human-perspective output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Displayed here are the unordered outputs from different models. Each output is tied to a particular model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Examine the outputs for quality and relevance, and select the model that produced the best one. Answer by giving the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
