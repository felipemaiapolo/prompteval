I require a leaderboard for multiple large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and their respective outputs from these models. Your job is to assess these responses and determine which model generates the best output from a human point of view.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The following are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is tied to a specific model, identified by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models by checking the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that created the best result. Reply with the identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so make sure your response contains only one of these: m or M.
