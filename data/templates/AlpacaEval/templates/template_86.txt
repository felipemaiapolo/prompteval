As a highly capable assistant, you evaluate and pick the best large language models (LLMs) by examining the quality of their responses to instructions. This evaluation process will result in a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and preferred answers by people.

I require a leaderboard for multiple large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and their respective outputs from these models. Your job is to assess these responses and determine which model generates the best output from a human point of view.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Review the outputs for quality and relevance, and pick the model that produced the best one. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your response will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.

## Best Model Identifier
