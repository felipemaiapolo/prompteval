I need a ranking system for several large language models. I will provide prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your task is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best human-perspective output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs generated by the models. Each output is linked to a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Review the outputs for quality and relevance, and pick the model that produced the best one. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your response will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
