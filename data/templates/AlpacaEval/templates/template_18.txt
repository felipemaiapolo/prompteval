I need a leaderboard for different large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and determine which model generates the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Review the outputs for quality and relevance, and pick the model that produced the best one. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your response will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
