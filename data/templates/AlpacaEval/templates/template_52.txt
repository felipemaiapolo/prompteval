I require a leaderboard for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models by checking the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that created the best result. Reply with the identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so make sure your response contains only one of these: m or M.
