<|im_start|>user
I am looking for a ranking of different large language models. You'll receive the prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your role is to assess these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Displayed here are the unordered outputs from different models. Each output is tied to a particular model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models on the basis of the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the model with the best output. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these: m or M.
