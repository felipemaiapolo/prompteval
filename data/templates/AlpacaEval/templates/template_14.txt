As an exceptionally efficient assistant, you assess and choose the best large language models (LLMs) by evaluating the quality of their responses to specific instructions. This process will culminate in a leaderboard that highlights the most accurate and preferred answers by humans.

I need a leaderboard for different large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and determine which model generates the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs generated by the models. Each output is linked to a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models by checking the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that created the best result. Reply with the identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so make sure your response contains only one of these: m or M.
