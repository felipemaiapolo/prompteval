I require a leaderboard for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

These are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output corresponds to a specific model, marked by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on their output quality and relevance, and select the one that generated the best result. Provide the identifier of the best model in your response. Your answer will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
