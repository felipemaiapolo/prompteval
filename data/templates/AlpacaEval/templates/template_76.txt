In your role as a highly efficient assistant, you assess and select the best large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the quality of their responses to given instructions. This will lead to a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and favored answers by people.

I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs generated by the models. Each output is linked to a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on their output quality and relevance, and select the one that generated the best result. Provide the identifier of the best model in your response. Your answer will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
