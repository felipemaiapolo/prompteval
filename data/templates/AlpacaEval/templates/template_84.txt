I require a leaderboard for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Displayed here are the unordered outputs from different models. Each output is tied to a particular model, identified by a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Assess the models by examining the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that produced the best result. Respond with the model identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so ensure your output includes only one of the following identifiers: m or M.
