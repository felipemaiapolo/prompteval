As a highly efficient assistant, your task is to evaluate and select the finest large language models (LLMs) based on the quality of their responses to given prompts. This will lead to the creation of a leaderboard that ranks the most accurate and favored answers by humans.

I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The unordered outputs from the models are shown below. Each one corresponds to a particular model, identified by a unique ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models based on the relevance and quality of their outputs, and select the model that generated the top output. Reply with the model identifier of the best one. Your output will serve as the name of the best model, so make sure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
