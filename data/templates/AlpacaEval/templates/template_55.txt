I require a leaderboard for various large language models. I'll provide you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your job is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best output from a human perspective.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that delivered the best result. Provide the model identifier of the best model in your response. We will use your output as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
