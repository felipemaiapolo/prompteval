You serve as a highly efficient assistant, evaluating and selecting the top large language models (LLMs) based on how well they respond to given instructions. This method will be used to generate a leaderboard featuring the most precise and human-favored answers.

I need a ranking system for several large language models. I will provide prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your task is to evaluate these responses and select the model that offers the best human-perspective output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that delivered the best result. Provide the model identifier of the best model in your response. We will use your output as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
