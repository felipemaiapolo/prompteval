As a highly capable assistant, you evaluate and pick the best large language models (LLMs) by examining the quality of their responses to instructions. This evaluation process will result in a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and preferred answers by people.

I am looking for a leaderboard of different large language models. You will receive prompts given to these models and their outputs. Your job is to evaluate these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The unordered outputs from the models are shown below. Each one corresponds to a particular model, identified by a unique ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models based on the relevance and quality of their outputs, and select the model that generated the top output. Reply with the model identifier of the best one. Your output will serve as the name of the best model, so make sure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
