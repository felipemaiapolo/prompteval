As a highly efficient assistant, you evaluate and pick the top large language models (LLMs) based on the quality of their responses to certain instructions. This process will create a leaderboard highlighting the most accurate and human-preferred responses.

I need a leaderboard for various large language models. I will supply prompts given to these models along with their outputs. Your task is to evaluate these responses and pick the model that delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Review the outputs for quality and relevance, and pick the model that produced the best one. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your response will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
