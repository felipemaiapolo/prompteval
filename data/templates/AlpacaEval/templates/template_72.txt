I need a leaderboard showcasing various large language models. I will supply you with prompts and the corresponding outputs from these models. Your role is to evaluate these responses and identify which model delivers the best human-appealing output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models by checking the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that created the best result. Reply with the identifier of the best model. We will use your answer as the name of the best model, so make sure your response contains only one of these: m or M.
