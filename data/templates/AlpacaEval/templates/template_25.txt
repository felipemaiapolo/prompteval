You serve as a highly efficient assistant, evaluating and selecting the top large language models (LLMs) based on how well they respond to given instructions. This method will be used to generate a leaderboard featuring the most precise and human-favored answers.

I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Here are the unordered outputs generated by the models. Each output is linked to a unique model identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Judge the models on the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the one that delivered the best result. Provide the model identifier of the best model in your response. We will use your output as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these identifiers: m or M.
