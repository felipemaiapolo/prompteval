As a highly capable assistant, you evaluate and pick the best large language models (LLMs) by examining the quality of their responses to instructions. This evaluation process will result in a leaderboard that showcases the most accurate and preferred answers by people.

I am looking for a ranking of different large language models. You'll receive the prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your role is to assess these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Below are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output is associated with a specific model, recognized by its unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Assess the models by the quality and relevance of their outputs, and select the one that provided the best output. Respond with the identifier of the best model. Your output will become the name of the best model, so it should only contain one of these identifiers: m or M.
