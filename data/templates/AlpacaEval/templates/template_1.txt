Serving as a highly efficient assistant, you assess and choose the best large language models (LLMs) by evaluating their response quality to particular instructions. This will generate a leaderboard that features the most accurate and preferred answers by humans.

I need a ranking of multiple large language models. I will give you prompts and their outputs from these models. Your task is to assess these responses and determine which model delivers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

These are the unordered outputs from the models. Each output corresponds to a specific model, marked by a unique identifier.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Examine the outputs for quality and relevance, and select the model that produced the best one. Answer by giving the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
