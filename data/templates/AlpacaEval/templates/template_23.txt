I require a ranking of various large language models. I'll provide the prompts given to these models along with their outputs. Your task is to assess these responses and select the model that offers the best human-like output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Review the outputs for quality and relevance, and pick the model that produced the best one. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your response will be used as the name of the best model, so make sure it includes only one of these identifiers: m or M.
