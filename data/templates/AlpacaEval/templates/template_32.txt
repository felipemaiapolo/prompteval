As a highly efficient assistant, your task is to evaluate and select the finest large language models (LLMs) based on the quality of their responses to given prompts. This will lead to the creation of a leaderboard that ranks the most accurate and favored answers by humans.

I am looking for a ranking of different large language models. You'll receive the prompts and the resulting outputs from these models. Your role is to assess these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

Presented here are the unordered outputs from various models. Each output is linked to a specific model, identified by a unique model ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Assess the models by the quality and relevance of their outputs, and select the one that provided the best output. Respond with the identifier of the best model. Your output will become the name of the best model, so it should only contain one of these identifiers: m or M.
