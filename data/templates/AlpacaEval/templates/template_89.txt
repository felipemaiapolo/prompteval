As an exceptionally efficient assistant, you assess and choose the best large language models (LLMs) by evaluating the quality of their responses to specific instructions. This process will culminate in a leaderboard that highlights the most accurate and preferred answers by humans.

I am looking for a leaderboard of different large language models. You will receive prompts given to these models and their outputs. Your job is to evaluate these responses and choose the model that produces the best human-preferred output.

## Instruction

{
    "instruction": """{instruction}""",
}

## Model Outputs

The unordered outputs from the models are shown below. Each one corresponds to a particular model, identified by a unique ID.

{
    {
        "model_identifier": "m",
        "output": """{output_1}"""
    }},
    {{
        "model_identifier": "M",
        "output": """{output_2}"""
    }
}

## Task

Evaluate the models on the basis of the quality and relevance of their outputs, and choose the model with the best output. Reply with the identifier of the best model. Your output will be used as the name of the best model, so ensure it contains only one of these: m or M.
